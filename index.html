                        I'm a self-taught programmer with interests in philosophy, theoretical physics, languages, and culture.
                        In short, I am a constant figure on the road to knowledge.  In my spare time, I enjoy singing, cooking, and solving logic puzzles.

                    I initially considered Columbia University while still enlisted in the
                    Army.  At the time, I wanted to become a U.S. Foreign Service Officer,
                    and I reasoned New York City would provide many opportunities to meet
                    U.N. diplomats and listen to foreign policy thought leaders.  Given
                    Columbia's excellent Political Science and East Asian Studies
                    departments, I was able to do this and much more!
