                    <p>
                        I'm a self-taught programmer with interests in a broad range of disciplines.
                        Currently digesting topics in philosophy, theoretical physics, computer science, and psychology.
                        In short, I am a constant fixture on the road to knowledge.  In my spare time, I enjoy singing, cooking, and solving logic puzzles.
