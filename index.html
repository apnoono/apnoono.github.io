        <p>I initially considered Columbia University while still enlisted in the

           and I reasoned New York City would provide many opportunities to meet
         U.N. diplomats and listen to foreign policy thought leaders.  Given
         Columbia's excellent Political Science and East Asian Studies
         departments, I was able to do this and much more!</p>
